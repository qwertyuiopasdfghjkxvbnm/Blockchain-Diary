# Blockchain Diary

A simple decentralized diary application built using Ethereum, Web3.js, and MetaMask. This application allows users to securely add and view diary entries, with the data stored on the blockchain for immutability and transparency.

## Features

- **Connect MetaMask**: Connect your MetaMask wallet to the app to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Add Diary Entries**: Write and store your diary entries securely on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **View Diary Entries**: Retrieve and display all diary entries from the blockchain.

## Technologies Used

- **Ethereum**: The Ethereum blockchain for decentralized storage of diary entries.
- **Web3.js**: A JavaScript library to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
- **MetaMask**: A browser extension that acts as a bridge to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
- **HTML/CSS**: Basic web technologies for the frontend of the application.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use this application, ensure you have the following:

1. **MetaMask** installed and set up in your browser.
2. **Ethereum testnet or mainnet setup** in MetaMask (depending on where your contract is deployed).
3. **A deployed smart contract** on the Ethereum blockchain. You will need the contract's ABI and deployed address.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/blockchain-diary.git
cd blockchain-diary
```
````

### 2. Replace Contract Information

In the `index.html` file, replace the following placeholder values with your smart contract's ABI and deployed address:

- `const contractAddress = "YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS";` – Replace with your deployed contract's address.
- `const contractABI = [...]` – Replace with the ABI of your smart contract.

### 3. Deploy Smart Contract

If you don't have a smart contract, you can deploy one using Solidity on the Ethereum network. Here’s an example of a simple contract for storing diary entries:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract BlockchainDiary {
    string[] public diaryEntries;

    function addDiaryEntry(string memory entry) public {
        diaryEntries.push(entry);
    }

    function getDiaryEntryCount() public view returns (uint256) {
        return diaryEntries.length;
    }

    function getDiaryEntry(uint256 entryId) public view returns (string memory) {
        require(entryId < diaryEntries.length, "Entry does not exist.");
        return diaryEntries[entryId];
    }
}
```

### 4. Open the Application

Open `index.html` in your browser (preferably with MetaMask installed).

### 5. Interact with the App

- **Connect MetaMask**: Click the "Connect MetaMask" button to connect your wallet.
- **Add a Diary Entry**: Write your diary entry in the provided text area and click "Add Entry" to store it on the blockchain.
- **View Diary Entries**: All diary entries will be displayed below the input area.

## How It Works

1. **Connect MetaMask**: The app uses `Web3.js` to request access to the MetaMask account. Once connected, it displays the user's Ethereum address.
2. **Add Diary Entry**: When a user writes a diary entry and clicks "Add Entry", the app calls the `addDiaryEntry` method on the smart contract and stores the entry on the blockchain.
3. **Load Diary Entries**: The app loads all diary entries by calling the `getDiaryEntryCount` and `getDiaryEntry` functions to retrieve the entries stored on the blockchain.

## Notes

- The app is designed to be used with a test network (such as Rinkeby or Goerli) for testing purposes. You can deploy the smart contract to a test network and use MetaMask to interact with it.
- Ensure you have some test Ether for interacting with the blockchain (e.g., to pay for gas fees).

### How to Use the README:

- Replace `YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` with the deployed address of your smart contract.
- Add the actual ABI in place of the placeholder ABI in the JavaScript section of the HTML.
- Include instructions for deploying the contract and any other relevant details about how the app works or can be modified.

Let me know if you need anything else!
